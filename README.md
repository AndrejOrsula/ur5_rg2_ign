# ur5_rg2_ign

URDF and SDF descriptions of Universal Robot 5 (UR5) robot with OnRobot RG2 gripper for Ignition and MoveIt2.

![ur5_rg2](ur5_rg2/thumbnails/2.png)
**Inertial properties** of all links are estimated with [estimate_inertial_properties.py](scripts/estimate_inertial_properties.py) script, while assuming total mass of 18.4 kg (UR5) + 0.78 kg (RG2) and uniform density. This script also redistributes a potion of hand's mass to fingers due to internal mechanical coupling.

The SDF description also contains estimated **dynamic parameters** for joints. Note that these values are NOT based on real-life robot and should therefore be used with caution.

> Kinematic model of gripper is simplified to include only a single actuated revolute joint per finger. The full model would include one actuated and two passive revolute joints, however, I could not achieve stable manipulation with that approach (contributions are welcome if you figure it out).

## Instructions

### ROS 2 (Optional)

Build with `colcon` and source the environment to make URDF discoverable for ROS 2.

### Ignition

Export `IGN_GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH` to make SDF discoverable within the context of Ignition Gazebo.

```bash
export IGN_GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH=${PARENT_DIR}/ur5_rg2_ign:${IGN_GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH}
```

Alternatively, you can just include the model from [Ignition Fuel](https://app.ignitionrobotics.org/AndrejOrsula/fuel/models/ur5_rg2) if you do not require the URDF description (or you use it from the official, e.g. from [Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver](https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver)).

```xml
<include>
    <uri>https://fuel.ignitionrobotics.org/1.0/AndrejOrsula/models/ur5_rg2</uri>
</include>
```
